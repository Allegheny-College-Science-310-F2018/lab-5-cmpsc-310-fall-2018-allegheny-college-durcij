# Reflection by Jordan Durci

## AI

### Algorithm

I have yet to fully implement an algorithm, but at the moment, I have added a new state that I call "Angry," wherein the enemies attack twice as fast, hitting 4 times per second, as opposed to the standard 2 times per second.

## Visual

### Player Character

I changed the textures to make the player character look like a cloth doll.  I also added color to the "skin" to make it look like burlap, and I changed the color of the "clothing" to be pink.  I also changed the maps that affect how lighting hits the player character to make the texture work a bit better, that said, I think my bumpmap shift is far from perfect.

### Enemies

#### Zombunny

I tweaked the emissive texture to have a neon green glow.  This makes the Zombunny look green in the dark, but light blue in the light.  I also added a neon green light source to the Zombunny.

#### Zombear

I tweaked the main texture to have the paint be a strong purple, and then tweaked the emissive texture to be a neon pink.  This makes the Zombear look bright pink in the dark, and in the right lighting, purple.  I also changed the color of the light source to match the new emissive colors.

#### Hellephant

I tweaked the emissive texture to be a very saturated and bright red.  This makes the Hellephant look red in the dark, but yellow in the light.  I matched its light source to the new emissive color.

### UI

#### Health UI

I changed the color of the player health bar to match the heart sprite, and added a HP number to help make it clearer.

#### Victory Screen

I added a new part of the UI, a victory screen.  It comes up when the player scores 1500 or more points, though 1500 is the maximum displayed.

### Lighting

I made tweaks to the lighting to make my changes to the emissives a little clearer.
